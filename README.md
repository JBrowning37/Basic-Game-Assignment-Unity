# Basic-Game-Assignment-Unity

This was the final assignment in the C# and Unity Course from The Tech Academy. The task was to create a quick game that showcases what I had learned. It had to have a main menu and a main game level.
The game had to have a win condition that resulted in the player being alerted that they had won. Other than those perameters we could make anything.

The minigame I chose to make is titled Rat Quest. This was a quick coding challenge that features basic level design and knoweldge of Unity mechanics.
In it you play as a rat in an alley. You need to pick up all the keys, unlock the cage, and free your rat friend.
